## Amazon Lex Bot Recommendation Integration

### Stitch Amazon Lex Conversation Logs with Amazon Connect Contact Lens Transcripts

Amazon Connect Contact Flows that interact with Amazon Lex bots do not have the Amazon Lex part of the interactions included as part of the transcripts written to Aamzon S3 by Contact Lens. This script helps stich together Amazon Lex Conversation Logs with the Amazon Connect Contact Lens Transcripts so bot developers can submit holistic conversations as input for bot recommendations to be generated by Amazon Lex. The transcripts stitched together are uploaded back into Amazon S3.

#### Usage

```
python3 stitch_conversation_logs_and_contact_lens_transcripts.py --source my-contact-lens-bucket --access_key MYACCESSKEY --secret_key MYSECRETKEY --region us-west-2 --cloudwatch_log_group_name MyLexCloudWatchLogGroupName
```
